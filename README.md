The Effect of Kernel Size on Feature Extraction in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
The code file named "Kernal Comparison" has two cells, the first cell uses mnist dataset to show the comparison of 3x3 and 5x5 kernal accuracy and computataion time
And the second cell in this file" Kernal Comparison" generates a random 10x10 greyscale image on which we apply three kernels 3x3, 5x5 and 7x7
These both cells can be run on google colab, all the libraries that are required for them are already added and the dataset is directly imported into code. 
The PDF file of the tutorial is also here in the repository and can be accessed.
